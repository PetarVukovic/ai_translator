This lecture is called \\'Manna and Matthew 6:33\\'.\\n3\\n00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:13,180\\nI see a great need for believers to truly understand with their hearts.\\n4\\n00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:37,760\\nHow the only foreseen, by the Divine Father, way of traveling for all of us from Egypt, which is the starting point,\\n5\\n00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,840\\nthrough the wilderness or desert towards the promised land.\\n6\\n00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:55,400\\nThe only foreseen path is the path of faith, therefore a miraculous path.\\n7\\n00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:11,130\\nWhat do I actually want to say with that, and to whom do I actually want to say it?\\n8\\n00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:33,150\\nI want to say to all of you who live a natural way of life, therefore in disbelief, that you will not achieve the goal for which you live on earth.\\n9\\n00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,210\\nThat is impossible.\\n10\\n00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:48,550\\nMy righteous one, and the opposite is not my unrighteous one, will live by faith.\\n11\\n00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,830\\nHebrews 10:38.\\n12\\n00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:11,170\\nAnd if he falls away, therefore does not live by faith, but by sight, 2 Corinthians 5:7, by his own mind, relying on his own strength or the strength of another man, he is not pleasing to my soul.\\n13\\n00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:22,990\\nTherefore, the only foreseen way or means of travel, Hebrews 11, is by faith.\\n14\\n00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,950\\nTherefore miraculously.\\n15\\n00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:42,510\\nGuided, protected, and provided for.\\n16\\n00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,190\\nGood Shepherd, Psalm 23:1, expanded version.\\n17\\n00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,950\\nGives you those epithets of a good shepherd.\\n18\\n00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,130\\nI see that very few people live like that.\\n19\\n00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,530\\nThat means they are on the wrong path that does not lead to the promised land or towards the goal.\\n20\\n00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,149\\nTo help them understand that and change so that they succeed are my honorable intentions.\\n21\\n00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:33,690\\nThis is a lecture, it could be the first, maybe it will be the only one, it depends, called \\'Manna and Matthew 6:33\\'.\\n22\\n00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,170\\nOn the table is booklet number 68, you already know, I personally think it is the most important practical booklet we have.\\n23\\n00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:50,050\\nThe revelation that I opened, we have already used it, a mini-seminar has already been according to it, 4892, but that is only because of the sentence\\n24\\n00:04:50,730 --> 00:05:11,430\\nwhich is consistent with my revelation, and that is: \"I allow them to receive everything they need and my gifts of grace often flow to them in a miraculous way.\" Often in a miraculous way.\\n25\\n00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:29,230\\nA historical picture, which is not accidental in the Holy Scripture, but is there for us to learn, we who live in the last times, from the mistakes of our ancestors.\\n26\\n00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:48,470\\nAnd I mean, spiritual ancestors, as the apostle teaches us in the first Corinthians tenth chapter, first to thirteenth verse, with emphasis, let\\'s open it now and read it, on the sixth to eleventh verse.\\n27\\n00:05:49,470 --> 00:06:09,710\\nHe says: \"These things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.\" And listen, because the fifth verse: \"But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were scattered in the wilderness.\"\\n28\\n00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:34,710\\nHere, if you are not pleasing to God, and you are not if you do not walk and live by faith, Hebrews 11:6 and Hebrews 10:38, then you are spiritually killed through the trials you encounter on your earthly path, and they concern your concern for the world and existence in the world, because that is what worries people.\\n29\\n00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:44,930\\nThat concern is disbelief and you are not pleasing to Him and you do not satisfy Him and that is a sign that you are spiritually dead.\\n30\\n00:06:49,760 --> 00:07:08,960\\nThere is no other foreseen path for man to the promised land, therefore to heaven, union with Christ, becoming like Christ in everything, except walking by faith.\\n31\\n00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:28,660\\nIn that case, you are miraculously provided for, guided, and protected, because the Lord is your shepherd. Psalm 23:1 expanded and Psalm 23:1-6 the entire psalm.\\n32\\n00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:53,970\\nWe have a picture of this in the Old Testament. When I say manna and Matthew 6:33, I mean miraculous nourishment, which is the only form of nourishment that was foreseen for them until they enter the promised land.\\n33\\n00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:11,270\\nA miraculous form of nourishment. But that is not the only miraculous thing, so I have taken out the sequence for you, although I will not introduce you to the verses now, that is not our topic.\\n34\\n00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:27,370\\nTheir deliverance from Egypt was miraculous. The passage through the Red Sea, which is the entrance into a new phase, where what is called the wilderness begins, was miraculous.\\n35\\n00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:55,400\\nThe guidance was miraculous because they had a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Their shoes and clothes did not tear along the entire length of the journey, food fell from the sky, and water gushed from the rock.\\n36\\n00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,360\\nHe promised to be their healer, not that they would have their own doctors.\\n37\\n00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:22,390\\nThe scripture says, let\\'s build a case, that these things became our examples, to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.\\n38\\n00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:48,190\\nObviously, they had all the available blessings to achieve the promised and obtain the secured, but they did not do it and they did not succeed in it because they lusted after evil things.\\n39\\n00:09:50,530 --> 00:10:06,890\\nHere are listed four main forms of evil that are the reason for their failure, so they were killed in the desert. For us, that means we are spiritually dead in this world, that is, we live naturally, that means you are spiritually dead.\\n40\\n00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:18,310\\nNumber one, do not be idolaters as some of them were. Everyone is an idolater to whom Christ and the Kingdom are not in first place.\\n41\\n00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:36,310\\nAs it is written: \"The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.\" Then: \"Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.\" That would be that the body and lusts rule over the spiritual life.\\n42\\n00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:51,830\\nAnd then what particularly interests us: \"Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents.\" To tempt means whether He will fulfill His word or not, whether we will believe Him in His word or not.\\n43\\n00:10:51,830 --> 00:11:14,310\\nAnd the tenth verse says. \"Nor complain, as some of them also complained.\" Therefore, they are dissatisfied with the destined arrangement, so they want something of their own, so \"were destroyed by the destroyer.\" These are four cardinal evils. For them, that means physical death, for you, us, that means spiritual death and eventually physical.\\n44\\n00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:32,670\\nAnd then the eleventh verse says: \"Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.\" You have a picture and sound, that is six to eleven.\\n45\\n00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:41,810\\nAnd in fact five to eleven, because eleven and five talk about the fact that it is written as an example for us and why it is written.\\n46\\n00:11:43,380 --> 00:12:03,560\\nAnd then it says: \"Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.\" And then it says something very important, if understood in context, that no one in those difficult circumstances of ours, where there is great concern and where we do not have and how we will and that, is given a greater temptation than he can bear, together with the temptation is, in faith, it is not written, but in faith, a way out is given.\\n47\\n00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:18,320\\nIf any of you still do not live by faith, how to live by faith, living by faith is described in Hebrews chapter 11.\\n48\\n00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:41,820\\nAnd that is a righteous way of life as opposed to an unrighteous one, one leads to the goal, the other leads to destruction. Only those who live by the faith that Hebrews 11 speaks of are righteous as He is righteous.\\n49\\n00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:52,340\\nThey are children of God, not children of the devil, and they are on the way to the goal. 1 John 3:7-10.\\n50\\n00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:10,030\\nThe main thought, the only foreseen path for all of us towards the goal to the promised land is believing\\n51\\n00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:31,530\\nthe Father, here Jesus, in the word of promise, by which word of promise we live and have by grace everything necessary for life and godliness,\\n52\\n00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:41,790\\nbut we must, 2 Peter 1:3 and 4 escape from the corruption that is in the world through lust.\\n53\\n00:13:47,830 --> 00:14:00,300\\nIf you do not live by faith, then you deprive yourself of miraculous guidance, provision, and protection.\\n54\\n00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,460\\nAnd you yourself will not succeed, you will die spiritually or you will not wake up spiritually.\\n55\\n00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,280\\nAnd such are the majority in the Christian church.\\n56\\n00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,700\\nIf Israel is a picture for us, everything around them was miraculous.\\n57\\n00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:37,470\\nThey opposed it because of four cardinal evils and that is why they left their bones in the desert.\\n58\\n00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:46,410\\nSo, you must find a way to walk towards the goal by faith.\\n59\\n00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,870\\nOtherwise, you will not succeed in life.\\n60\\n00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,540\\nWithout faith it is impossible to please God.\\n61\\n00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,060\\nHe who falls away from faith is not pleasing to His soul.\\n62\\n00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,120\\nHebrews 10:38 and Hebrews 11:6.\\n63\\n00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,320\\nWhat does that mean?\\n64\\n00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:27,720\\nIt means that you live Matthew 6:33 believing in the promise, therefore in fellowship with the Father.\\n65\\n00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:39,660\\nMiraculously guided, provided for, and protected along the entire length of the journey.\\n66\\n00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,640\\nEverything else leads to destruction.\\n67\\n00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,280\\nOwn mind, own strengths, own arrangement of life.\\n68\\n00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:02,540\\nTherefore, if any of you do not live Matthew 6:33, you are preparing your destruction.\\n69\\n00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,300\\nBecause you live in disbelief.\\n70\\n00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:20,060\\nThere is no other foreseen path from Egypt through the wilderness to the promised land\\n71\\n00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,380\\nexcept the one of believing\\n72\\n00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,320\\nin Divine promises, here Matthew 6:33.\\n73\\n00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,120\\nThis is the lecture \\'Manna and Matthew 6:33\\'.\\n74\\n00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,620\\nMaybe there will be one lecture, maybe there will be more, in any case of that name.\\n75\\n00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,200\\nThe revelation on the table is from booklet number 68.\\n76\\n00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:01,500\\nI have already used it for a mini-seminar, and now I am using it, except because it is magnificent,\\n77\\n00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,980\\nbecause it mentions miraculous provision.\\n78\\n00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079\\nEverything by faith is miraculous\\n79\\n00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:19,940\\nbecause believing in Him, through His word, we enable Him to fulfill His word.\\n80\\n00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:29,220\\nAnd His action, where He is faithful to His promise and fulfills it in our lives, is a miraculous action.\\n81\\n00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,650\\nAnd so we must walk towards the promised land.\\n82\\n00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,070\\nAre you with me?\\n83\\n00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:48,970\\nThat is not how most walk and this lecture is directed to them, because they are in mortal danger.\\n84\\n00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,110\\nThat is the wide path that leads to destruction.\\n85\\n00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,410\\nMatthew 7:13,14.\\n86\\n00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,970\\nPsalm 78 speaks of them.\\n87\\n00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:08,270\\nA lesson from history, so I will read that to you too, or at least start reading, but I want you to understand the problem.\\n88\\n00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,010\\nThis is of course neither seen nor understood who the problem is.\\n89\\n00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,750\\nHere I will read the first eight verses\\n90\\n00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,270\\nfor now, says an instructive song, therefore a lesson from the past.\\n91\\n00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,310\\nThat is what 1 Corinthians 10:1-13 calls us to do.\\n```' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run-334c478c-75de-4890-9caf-1d5dd75b6fe9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5858, 'output_tokens': 5050, 'total_tokens': 10908, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"
