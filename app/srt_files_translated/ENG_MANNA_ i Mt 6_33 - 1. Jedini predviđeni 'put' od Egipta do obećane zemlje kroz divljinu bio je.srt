1
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:40,710
So, this is the first lecture, and maybe it will be the last, only this one, but for now it's the first lecture,
2
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:56,280
now it's hard for me to say seminar. This lecture is called 'Manna and Matthew 6:33'.
3
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:13,180
I see a great need for believers to truly understand with their hearts.
4
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:37,760
How the only foreseen, by the Divine Father, way of traveling for all of us from Egypt, which is the starting point,
5
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,840
through the wilderness or desert towards the promised land.
6
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:55,400
The only foreseen path is the path of faith, therefore a miraculous path.
7
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:11,130
What do I actually want to say with that, and to whom do I actually want to say it?
8
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:33,150
I want to say to all of you who live a natural way of life, therefore in disbelief, that you will not achieve the goal for which you live on earth.
9
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,210
That is impossible.
10
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:48,550
My righteous one, and the opposite is not my unrighteous one, will live by faith.
11
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,830
Hebrews 10:38.
12
00:02:52,590 --> 00:03:11,170
And if he falls away, therefore does not live by faith, but by sight, 2 Corinthians 5:7, by his own mind, relying on his own strength or the strength of another man, he is not pleasing to my soul.
13
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:22,990
Therefore, the only foreseen way or means of travel, Hebrews 11, is by faith.
14
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,950
Therefore miraculously.
15
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:42,510
Guided, protected, and provided for.
16
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,190
Good Shepherd, Psalm 23:1, expanded version.
17
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,950
Gives you those epithets of a good shepherd.
18
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,130
I see that very few people live like that.
19
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,530
That means they are on the wrong path that does not lead to the promised land or towards the goal.
20
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:20,149
My honorable intentions are to help them understand this and change so that they succeed.
21
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:33,690
This is a lecture, it could be the first, maybe it will be the only one, it depends, called 'Manna and Matthew 6:33'.
22
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:42,170
On the table is booklet number 68, you already know, I personally think it is the most important practical booklet we have.
23
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:50,050
The revelation that I opened, we have already used it, a mini-seminar has already been based on it, 4892, but that is only because of the sentence
24
00:04:50,730 --> 00:05:11,430
which is consistent with my revelation, and that is: "I allow them to receive everything they need, and my gifts of grace often flow to them in a miraculous way." Often in a miraculous way.
25
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:29,230
A historical picture, which is not accidental in the Holy Scripture, but is there for us to learn, we who live in the last times, from the mistakes of our ancestors.
26
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:48,470
And I mean, spiritual ancestors, as the apostle teaches us in the first Corinthians chapter ten, verses one to thirteen, with emphasis, let's open it now and read it, on verses six to eleven.
27
00:05:49,470 --> 00:06:09,710
He says: "These things became our examples, that we should not desire evil things as they also desired." And listen, because verse five: "But with most of them God was not well pleased, for they were scattered in the wilderness."
28
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:34,710
Here, if you are not pleasing to God, and you are not if you do not walk and live by faith, Hebrews 11:6 and Hebrews 10:38, then you are spiritually killed through the trials you encounter on your earthly path, and they concern your concern for the world and existence in the world, because that is what worries people.
29
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:44,930
That concern is disbelief, and you are not pleasing to Him and you do not satisfy Him, and that is a sign that you are spiritually dead.
30
00:06:49,760 --> 00:07:08,960
There is no other foreseen path for man to the promised land, therefore to heaven, union with Christ, becoming like Christ in everything, except walking by faith.
31
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:28,660
In that case, you are miraculously provided for, guided, and protected, because the Lord is your shepherd. Psalm 23:1 expanded and Psalm 23:1-6 the entire psalm.
32
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:53,970
We have a picture of this in the Old Testament. When I say manna and Matthew 6:33, I mean miraculous nourishment, which is the only form of nourishment that was foreseen for them until they enter the promised land.
33
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:11,270
A miraculous form of nourishment. But that is not the only miraculous thing, so I have taken out a sequence for you, although I will not introduce you to the verses now, that is not our topic.
34
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:27,370
Their deliverance from Egypt was miraculous. The passage through the Red Sea, which is the entrance into a new phase, where what is called the wilderness begins, was miraculous.
35
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:55,400
The guidance was miraculous because they had a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Their shoes and clothes did not wear out along the entire journey, food fell from the sky, and water gushed from the rock.
36
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,360
He promised to be their healer, not that they would have their own doctors.
37
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:22,390
The scripture says, let's build a case, that these things became our examples, that we should not desire evil things as they also desired.
38
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:48,190
Obviously, they had all the available blessings to achieve the promised and obtain the secured, but they did not do it and did not succeed in it because they desired evil things.
39
00:09:50,530 --> 00:10:06,890
Here are listed four main forms of evil that are the reason for their failure, so they were killed in the desert. For us, that means we are spiritually dead in this world, that is, we live naturally, that means you are spiritually dead.
40
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:18,310
Number one, do not be idolaters as some of them were. Everyone is an idolater to whom Christ and the Kingdom are not first.
41
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:36,310
As it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play." Then: "Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell." That would be that the body and lusts rule over the spiritual life.
42
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:51,830
And then what particularly interests us: "Nor let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed by serpents." To tempt means whether He will fulfill His word or not, whether we will believe Him in His word or not.
43
00:10:51,830 --> 00:11:14,310
And verse ten says. "Nor complain, as some of them also complained." Therefore, dissatisfied with the destined arrangement, so they want something of their own, so "were destroyed by the destroyer." These are four cardinal evils. For them, that means physical death, for you, us, that means spiritual death and eventually physical.
44
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:32,670
And then verse eleven says: "Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come." You have picture and sound, that is six to eleven.
45
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:41,810
And in fact five to eleven, because eleven and five talk about that it is written as an example for us and why it is written.
46
00:11:43,380 --> 00:12:03,560
And then it says: "Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall." And then it says something very important, if understood in context, that no one in those difficult circumstances of ours, where there is great concern and where we do not have and how we will, is given a greater temptation than he can bear, together with the temptation is, in faith, it is not written, but in faith, a way out is given.
47
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:18,320
If any of you still do not live by faith, how to live by faith, living by faith is described in Hebrews chapter 11.
48
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:41,820
And that is a righteous way of life as opposed to an unrighteous one, one leads to the goal, the other leads to destruction. Only those who live by the faith that Hebrews 11 speaks of are righteous as He is righteous.
49
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:52,340
They are children of God, not children of the devil, and are on the way to the goal. 1 John 3:7-10.
50
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:10,030
The main thought, the only foreseen path for all of us towards the goal to the promised land is believing
51
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:31,530
the Father, here Jesus, in the word of promise, by which word of promise we live and have by grace everything necessary for life and godliness,
52
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:41,790
but we must, 2 Peter 1:3 and 4, escape from the corruption that is in the world through lust.
53
00:13:47,830 --> 00:14:00,300
If you do not live by faith, then you deprive yourself of miraculous guidance, provision, and protection.
54
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,460
And you yourself will not succeed, you will die spiritually or you will not wake up spiritually.
55
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,280
And such are the majority in the Christian church.
56
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,700
If Israel is a picture for us, everything around them was miraculous.
57
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:37,470
They opposed it because of four cardinal evils and therefore left their bones in the desert.
58
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:46,410
Therefore, you must find a way to walk towards the goal by faith.
59
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,870
Otherwise, you will not succeed in life.
60
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,540
Without faith it is impossible to please God.
61
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,060
He who falls away from faith is not pleasing to His soul.
62
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,120
Hebrews 10:38 and Hebrews 11:6.
63
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,320
What does that mean?
64
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:27,720
It means that you live Matthew 6:33 believing in the promise, therefore in fellowship with the Father.
65
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:39,660
Miraculously guided, provided for, and protected along the entire journey.
66
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Everything else leads to destruction.
67
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,280
Own mind, own strengths, own arrangement of life.
68
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:02,540
Therefore, if any of you do not live Matthew 6:33, you are preparing your destruction.
69
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,300
Because you live in disbelief.
70
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:20,060
There is no other foreseen path from Egypt through the wilderness to the promised land
71
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,380
except the one of believing
72
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,320
in Divine promises, here Matthew 6:33.
73
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,120
This is the lecture 'Manna and Matthew 6:33'.
74
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,620
Maybe it will be one lecture, maybe there will be more, in any case of that name.
75
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,200
The revelation on the table is from booklet number 68.
76
00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:01,500
I have already used it for a mini-seminar, and now I am using it, except because it is magnificent,
77
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,980
because it mentions miraculous provision.
78
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
Everything by faith is miraculous
79
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:19,940
because believing in Him, through His word, we enable Him to fulfill His word.
80
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:29,220
And His action, where He is faithful to His promise and fulfills it in our lives, is a miraculous action.
81
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,650
And so we must walk towards the promised land.
82
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,070
Are you with me?
83
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:48,970
Most do not walk like that, and this lecture is directed at them, because they are in mortal danger.
84
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,110
That is the wide path that leads to destruction.
85
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,410
Matthew 7:13,14.
86
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,970
Psalm 78 speaks of them.
87
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:08,270
A lesson from history, so I will read that to you too, or at least start reading, but I want you to understand the problem.
88
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,010
This is of course neither seen nor understood who the problem is.
89
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,750
Here I will read the first eight verses
90
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,270
for now, it says an instructive song, therefore a lesson from the past.
91
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,310
1 Corinthians 10:1-13 calls us to that.
92
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,410
emphasis on 6-10,
93
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,290
frame 6-11.
94
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,850
Or verses 6-11 frame the cardinal evils.
95
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,290
A didactic psalm of Asaph.
96
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,730
"Listen, my people, to my teaching; give ear to the words of my mouth.
97
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,190
I will open my mouth in a parable," listen, "I will utter hidden things, things from of oldâ
98
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,930
things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us.
99
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,930
We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation
100
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,750
the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord, his power, and the wonders he has done."
101
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:13,900
To begin with, we should be aware of who is calling us, who has promised us.
102
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,530
We must remember, it is repeated throughout the psalm, His wonderful works.
103
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:28,030
In such a master God, here the Father, we believe when we make decisions
104
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:33,670
and set priorities in life and arrange life accordingly.
105
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,430
Because in fact, when you rely on yourself, your mind, the world, friends,
106
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,630
you actually want to say that He is unfaithful and cannot, that He does not love you.
107
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,510
And that state is spiritual death.
108
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,390
And that is blindness from the master of the world and the path to ruin
109
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,890
according to 2 Corinthians four verses 3 and 4.
110
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,970
And that is another god you serve.
111
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,090
And that's why you're not well and you can't be well until you change that.
112
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:19,570
Because you live separated from divine grace, thereby in disbelief you deprive yourself of His grace.
113
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:26,790
There is no, this is the main thought, this is what I came to say, Jesus will accompany me with the rest,
114
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:34,150
there is no other way you can go to achieve the goal.
115
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,190
Except the way of believing in His promises,
116
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,410
thereby in Him.
117
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,350
Every other way is a path to ruin.
118
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:58,560
In other words, you must, if you are to succeed, find a way to put the Kingdom,
119
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,700
thereby the King and work for Him in the first place.
120
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,200
Otherwise you are in some evil or in all four.
121
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,460
Listed and described.
122
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
And it is quite certain that you will die.
123
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,500
You must learn to believe.
124
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,920
So, the only prescribed way of life for the righteous, and the others are unrighteous,
125
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:43,400
children of the devil, 1 John 3:10, puts in context 3:7-10.
126
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,220
He who is righteous cleanses himself as He is righteous.
127
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,560
So, do justice and love your neighbor,
128
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,860
he is a child of God, otherwise he is a child of the devil.
129
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,800
The only way of life that is acceptable for a believer,
130
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,200
and is called the life of the righteous or doing justice is by faith.
131
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:16,990
By faith.
132
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,710
As I explained last time at the worship service in Zagreb.
133
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:26,890
Are you with me?
134
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,790
Here, it just occurs to me to give you one example.
135
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,890
These are the famous Hebrews 11:8.
136
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,670
That verse is very important to me.
137
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,950
Because most haven't even started, it talks about
138
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,990
how Abraham, when he received the call, and that's you, that's Genesis 12:1,
139
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,670
and you got it as soon as you became Christians,
140
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:53,310
left his house, by faith called, Abraham obeyed.
141
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,030
By faith.
142
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,510
By faith.
143
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,990
Because this is the correct translation.
144
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,230
Now I will even open King James.
145
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,570
By faith Abraham, because this is wrong in the Croatian translation,
146
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,090
here in the Christian present,
147
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,310
this translation is really bad. Let's see how it writes.
148
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,190
Because here it says: "By faith called, Abraham obeyed."
149
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,270
So that is totally confusing and wrong.
150
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:22,850
King James reads: "By faith", because that is the correct translation,
151
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:29,330
"Abraham, when he was called to go to a place
152
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,310
where he will receive or which he will receive as an inheritance, obeyed.
153
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,150
And went out, not knowing where he was going."
154
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,370
Most of you haven't even started, because before you start,
155
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,210
you have to know where you are going.
156
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,170
And that is the life of the unrighteous who does not please God,
157
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:54,230
who does not please Him because he does not believe Him.
158
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
Can you follow this?
159
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,900
You have all divine help from day number one.
160
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,160
That's what Israel teaches us.
161
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,720
The deliverance was miraculous, the passage through the Red Sea was miraculous,
162
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,260
the healing was miraculous, the clothes did not tear for 40 years
163
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,280
on their feet, shoes and clothes on them,
164
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,600
food from heaven and water from the rock,
165
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,980
a cloud of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night.
166
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:41,930
Miraculous victory or victory in a miraculous way over the Amalekites.
167
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,490
Revelation from Sinai in a miracle.
168
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,280
If you do not learn to live by faith,
169
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,200
you will perish as unbelievers.
170
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,840
And that is clearly seen by your life in the world,
171
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,120
because you are put in situations that are wilderness for you,
172
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,020
and that is that your existence is in question.
173
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,960
And when life is in question, it shows what you are like,
174
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,960
because you are fighting for your life.
175
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,920
And if you fight by natural means,
176
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,940
it is because you are an unbeliever.
177
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:36,680
And no unbeliever will inherit the Kingdom of God.
178
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,850
Do I have any amen here?
179
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,610
Ok.
180
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,890
Has anyone here understood so far, I know you haven't,
181
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,730
you don't even understand how important this is when I tell you.
182
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,310
Because if you understood, the situation would change.
183
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,290
This is the most important practical booklet
184
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,790
we have, more important than all the gospels of love.
185
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,430
Than absolutely everything.
186
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,830
Than everything.
187
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,730
This is the framework and foundation of life.
188
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,070
Booklet number 68, four powerful words of Jesus.
189
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,950
My kingdom is not of this world.
190
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,270
John 18:36.
191
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,890
No one can serve two masters.
192
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,010
Matthew 6:24.
193
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,650
Seek the Kingdom of God first
194
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,010
and his righteousness, and all else will be added to you.
195
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,410
That is righteousness.
196
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,970
To live by faith.
197
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,910
Do you understand? Nothing will be added to you while you live in unbelief.
198
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,050
And then the Kingdom of Heaven is taken by force
199
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,590
and if it is taken, then my burden is light.
200
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:40,490
So, in fact, the last chapter has two verses,
201
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,870
but the main one is Matthew 11:12,
202
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,150
which is also Luke 16:16.
203
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,990
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
204
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,250
And this was Matthew 11:30 "My burden is light."
205
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,730
Do we have picture and sound?
206
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,780
And then we go back to Psalm
207
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,220
and that's 78.
208
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,140
Now we will go back with Hebrews.
209
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
And then it says:
210
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,200
"He established a testimony in Jacob,
211
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,700
and appointed a law in Israel,
212
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,360
that what he commanded our fathers
213
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,220
they should make known to their children.
214
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,200
That the generation to come might know,
215
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,380
even the children yet to be born,
216
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,000
that they in turn should tell their children.
217
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,340
So they would set their hope in God
218
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,280
and not forget the works of God,
219
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,920
but keep his commandments;
220
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,060
so that they would not be like their fathers,
221
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,160
a stubborn and rebellious generation,
222
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,500
a generation whose heart was not steadfast,
223
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,760
whose spirit was not faithful to God."
224
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,160
So, you must put your hope in God
225
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,100
and not forget his works
226
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,780
from the past and from your life
227
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,480
and then keep his commandments.
228
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,040
And the commandment is to put the Kingdom first.
229
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,320
If you don't do that,
230
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,460
you will be like their fathers,
231
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,700
which is a stubborn and rebellious generation,
232
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,760
a generation whose heart was not steadfast
233
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,480
and, listen, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
234
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,050
There is no possibility
235
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,570
that you will achieve the goal through unbelief.
236
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,450
My righteous one will live by faith.
237
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,910
And if he falls away, from what?
238
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,030
Well, from living by faith.
239
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,190
How does one fall away from living by faith?
240
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,430
When you live by unbelief.
241
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,930
My soul will have no pleasure in him.
242
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,010
Are you aware that most live
243
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,150
as unbelievers?
244
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,580
We love you, Jesus.
245
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,320
Amen.
246
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,690
Okay, I'm going to Revelation.
247
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,630
Revelation 4892,
248
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:36,590
third chapter of library number 68
249
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,810
the main part of the chapter because there is also an addition in the new edition.
250
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,890
Matthew 6:33
251
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,950
Seek first the Kingdom of God.
252
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,330
And now he repeats that important verse.
253
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,770
Seek first
254
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,710
the Kingdom of God
255
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,770
and His righteousness
256
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,230
and all else will be added to you.
257
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,810
If what you want is not added to you
258
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,940
and you murmur because of it
259
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,300
or show dissatisfaction
260
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,160
that is a cardinal sin.
261
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,840
You should be satisfied with what is added to you
262
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,020
because he is on your case
263
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,920
and adds to you according to your faith,
264
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,860
exactly how much you need.
265
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,000
There is no other foreseen path
266
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,260
to the promised land
267
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,760
than believing.
268
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,740
Every unbelief
269
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,820
will cost every unbeliever
270
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,340
that they will leave their bones in the desert.
271
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,980
And if someone says
272
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,060
,yes, but look at my circumstances,
273
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,980
they encounter that deception.
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,140
1 Corinthians 10:13
 indicates new line
275
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,880
"No temptation has overtaken you
 indicates new line
276
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful;
 indicates new line
277
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,520
he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.
 indicates new line
278
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,200
But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out
 indicates new line
279
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,640
so that you can endure it."
 indicates new line
280
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,880
Therefore, that is murmuring because of unbelief,
 indicates new line
281
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,670
and behind that is idolatry.
 indicates new line
282
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,950
And that is spiritual death.
 indicates new line
283
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,370
My righteous one will live by faith
 indicates new line
284
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,950
and that is it.
 indicates new line
285
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,410
How to live by faith
 indicates new line
286
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,890
we read right after in Hebrews 11.
 indicates new line
287
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,030
And that is why that chapter is of our interest.
 indicates new line
288
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,210
Because it describes the life of the righteous.
 indicates new line
289
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,190
I have noticed that deceived people in churches
 indicates new line
290
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,430
and that also applies to servants
 indicates new line
291
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,760
enter that chapter only to appropriate something.
 indicates new line
292
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,140
No, it describes the life of the righteous there.
 indicates new line
293
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
The righteous one according to Hebrews 11:8
 indicates new line
294
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,460
is the one who, when he receives a call,
 indicates new line
295
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,660
and the call is do this, do that
 indicates new line
296
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,070
not knowing what will happen
 indicates new line
297
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,430
but believes that good will happen.
 indicates new line
298
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,350
That is the life of the righteous.
 indicates new line
299
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,670
Everything else does not please the Lord God
 indicates new line
300
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,170
and is not pleasing to Him.
 indicates new line
301
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,390
Okay, now He says like this:
 indicates new line
302
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,350
"Hear what I want to tell you with these words."
 indicates new line
303
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,290
What do you want to tell us, Father?
 indicates new line
304
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,070
It is clear to you that no church in the world
 indicates new
305
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,250
has booklet number 68
 indicates new line
306
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,290
and that without it
 indicates new line
307
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,270
they are lost in space and time
 indicates new line
308
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
as most of you are
 indicates new line
309
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,600
and that will remain, and that is disastrous.
 indicates new line
310
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,440
And that is why He helps us
 indicates new line
311
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,360
because He reminds us of what He said
 indicates new line
312
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,740
and He Himself teaches
 indicates new line
313
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,840
John 14:26
 indicates new line
314
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,060
leading us into all truth
 indicates new line
315
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,980
John 16:13
 indicates new line
316
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,240
and that openly
 indicates new line
317
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,580
John 16:25
 indicates new line
318
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,560
Hear me what I want to tell you.
 indicates new line
319
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,480
So you know what is written.
 indicates new line
320
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,160
I know that you know
 indicates new line
321
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,500
what is written.
 indicates new line
322
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,120
But look at your life.
 indicates new line
323
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,960
Do you live by it?
 indicates new line
324
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,540
No.
 indicates new line
325
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,520
That is why you need help.
 indicates new line
326
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,940
"Hear me, therefore, what"
 indicates new line
327
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,480
we can put 'you' personally
 indicates new line
328
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,280
here it says 'you' "I want to tell you
 indicates new line
329
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,960
with these words you can always rely"
 indicates new line
330
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,120
reliance is faith
 indicates new line
331
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,800
"on my fatherly care."
 indicates new line
332
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,670
So the purpose of life is to
 indicates new line
333
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,190
establish the disrupted relationship with the Father
 indicates new line
334
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,530
it is disrupted because of sin
 indicates new line
335
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,989
and because of that sin we are separated
 indicates new line
336
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,170
and the state of sin is unbelief
 indicates new line
337
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,070
and the state of unbelief is resistance
 indicates new line
338
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,150
and then it is the impossibility for grace to manifest.
 indicates new line
339
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,730
And He gives us opportunities, because He puts us in trials
 indicates new line
340
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,090
so that we can reverse that process
 indicates new line
341
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,510
and that through faith,
 indicates new line
342
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,350
whereby love and trust are released,
 indicates new line
343
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,530
we establish a relationship.
 indicates new line
344
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,610
It is not so that you receive something
 indicates new line
345
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,250
and then a month passes.
 indicates new line
346
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,290
It is so that you establish a relationship.
 indicates new line
347
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,969
Do you even think like that?
 indicates new line
348
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,020
Because if you are interested in what you need to receive
 indicates new line
349
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,380
to survive the month
 indicates new line
350
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,620
or fulfill your desires,
 indicates new line
351
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,920
you are failing.
 indicates new line
352
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,880
The relationship is what He wants us to establish.
 indicates new line
353
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,740
That is "Our Father", see here we already have
 indicates new line
354
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,000
not our father, father.
 indicates new line
355
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,420
So He wants,
 indicates new line
356
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,060
He wants,
 indicates new line
357
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,480
I see that immediately.
 indicates new line
358
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,520
that we Matthew 6:33
 indicates new line
359
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,520
understand through father
 indicates new line
360
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,220
that He will
 indicates new line
361
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,140
always take care of us.
 indicates new line
362
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,840
How will He take care
 indicates new line
363
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,180
if we can
 indicates new line
364
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,280
and we take care.
365
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,900
Therefore, He places us in circumstances
366
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,620
where we cannot take care of ourselves.
367
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,000
Where we must believe in Him
368
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,620
to show us His love,
369
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,300
to awaken love,
370
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,160
that by returning love
371
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,400
we establish a relationship.
372
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,260
There is no other
373
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,600
foreseen path for anyone
374
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,100
to enter heaven,
375
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,000
union,
376
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,540
the promised land
377
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,680
except believing
378
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,020
in the Father's promises,
379
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,040
of which the most important is
380
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,520
Matthew 6:33
381
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,760
for our Christian walk.
382
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,340
Because, let's say if I,
383
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,720
that verse is very important to me,
384
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,460
for me, that's the most important verse,
385
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,320
and if it is
386
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,680
as far as faith itself is concerned,
387
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,800
dearer to me is 11.
388
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,180
Hebrews 11.
389
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,160
You already know: "By faith Sarah received power
390
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,700
to conceive, even when she was past the age,
391
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,480
because she considered him faithful who had promised.
392
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,140
"
393
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,800
Hebrews 11:8 is life.
394
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,040
If Hebrews 11:8
395
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,540
we look at through this prism,
396
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,200
we can understand
397
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,640
that a call means
398
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,320
here, do that,
399
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,460
that's a call
400
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,180
and I will take over all your worries
401
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,940
and I will
402
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,400
meet all your needs
403
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,600
and that is the land
404
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,100
in which you must live
405
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,960
and now you don't know how
406
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,240
and you don't see what He will do
407
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,100
and that's why you start
408
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,440
not knowing
409
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,240
and that's how the righteous live.
410
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,130
If you don't live like that,
411
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,170
you don't live because of one
412
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,910
of the four listed evils
413
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,090
or all four
414
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,530
and that is the life of the unrighteous
415
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,670
and you will not inherit the Kingdom.
416
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,980
I would just like to destroy
417
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,960
your deceptions
418
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,180
that there is another possibility,
419
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,180
there isn't.
420
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,720
Is there, I mean, correct me,
421
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:41,900
is there somewhere a verse:
422
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
"My righteous one will live by faith,
423
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,800
but can also live by unbelief"?
424
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,000
That is, pardon,
425
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,200
by faith, but can also live by unbelief.
426
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,590
Is that somewhere in your Bibles?
427
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,430
Now,
428
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,910
people have no idea what it means
429
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,590
to live by faith.
430
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,410
When someone prays
431
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,010
and his prayer goes through,
432
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,470
he doesn't live by faith.
433
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,370
You need to see his life.
434
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,510
Are you with me?
435
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Someone
436
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
who doesn't live by faith
437
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,200
relies on people.
438
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,240
That wouldn't be me.
439
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,260
And then if some man doesn't do something,
440
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,800
his life is in danger
441
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,020
because his trust is in man.
442
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,100
You never see that with me.
443
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,060
Are you with me?
444
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,560
And then he gets angry at the man
445
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,620
and that shows that he has no relationship with the Father.
446
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,560
Whatever people do,
447
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,820
the Lord is my shepherd.
448
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,880
Nothing He does to me
449
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,040
depends on you.
450
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,480
Only on me.
451
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,900
Can you understand this?
452
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,610
O blessed name of the Lord.
453
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,850
I mean, it's clear to you that this won't be just one lecture.
454
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,770
Has anyone figured out so far
455
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,310
that I won't be able to get out of this?
456
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,410
Has anyone here realized
457
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:21,790
that this won't be a little stream?
458
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,970
Huh?
459
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,130
Is anyone hearing me here?
460
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,110
There is no
461
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,610
bypass
462
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,490
to the promised land
463
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,570
if the A1 is closed.
464
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:46,090
The old road doesn't work.
465
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,850
There is no old road.
466
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,140
There is only the main highway.
467
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,500
And if you don't go on that highway
468
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,040
you won't arrive.
469
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:05,970
We love You, Jesus.
470
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,700
Therefore, we must with great seriousness,
471
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,580
with a humble heart
472
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,420
in surrender
473
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,040
pray
474
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
each individually
475
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,060
that the Father opens to us
476
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,960
the depth of this word
477
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,220
from Matthew 6:33.
478
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,340
Even when He explains it to us further
479
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,560
through revelation or here
480
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,820
through gift and mission.
481
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,200
Seek first
482
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,220
the Kingdom of God.
483
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,260
You must know what that means
484
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,580
and His righteousness
485
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,240
God's.
486
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,240
What is God's righteousness?
487
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,680
My righteous one will live by faith righteousness.
488
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,240
Pardon.
489
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,860
I have to correct myself
490
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,880
because that's the wrong translation.
491
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,840
The just shall live by faith.
492
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,420
The righteous
493
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,920
My righteous one will live
494
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,980
by faith.
495
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,880
How to live
496
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,420
by faith
497
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,900
is described in Hebrews chapter 11.
498
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,090
We love You, Jesus.
499
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,410
And then it says
500
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,000
when we fulfill the conditions
501
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,170
that are on our side
502
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,530
everything else will be
503
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,290
added to you.
504
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,270
And then it says:
505
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,590
"Listen
506
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,010
to what I want
507
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:45,530
to say
508
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,010
with these words."
509
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,420
Two points.
510
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,020
"You can always
511
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,880
rely on my
512
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,460
Fatherly care."
513
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,940
When we
514
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,060
don't rely
515
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,560
on His Fatherly care
516
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,840
then the Father
517
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,740
is excluded from the equation
518
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,240
and we live
519
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,700
by our own intelligence
520
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,380
outside the word of God
521
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,840
and with our own strength.
522
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,300
And that is the path of the blinded
523
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,440
that leads to ruin
524
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,740
because it is not the path of righteousness by faith.
525
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,920
Do you know that people don't think it's this serious?
526
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,960
That's why I'm taking the time
527
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,580
to make the situation serious.
528
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,180
We love You, Jesus.
529
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,960
Does anyone here realize
530
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,360
that this is more serious than they thought?
531
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,160
Okay, we have two, three witnesses,
532
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,840
that will be enough.
533
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,460
"Always",
534
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,040
not just when conditions are ideal,
535
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,740
always
536
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,000
whatever the conditions are,
537
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,720
always
538
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,160
"you can rely on my fatherly care."
539
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,740
Listen,
540
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,420
"if you live according to my will"
541
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,240
those are the conditions of course,
542
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,800
booklet 63,
543
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,800
revelation 3744,
544
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,600
Jesus' promises,
545
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,560
conditions - fulfillment.
546
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:22,920
So,
547
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,340
always
548
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,180
will
549
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,280
His word be fulfilled
550
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,260
if before that
551
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,840
we fulfill His word.
552
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,360
In order for this word to be fulfilled
553
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,700
in that part
554
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,460
that is of our particular interest,
555
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,700
and that is, and everything else will be added to you,
556
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,740
we have conditions to fulfill
557
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,060
in the first part of that promise,
558
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,420
and that is
559
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,940
seek first,
560
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,920
above all
561
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,480
the Kingdom of God
562
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,860
by doing his righteousness.
563
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,660
It is important to do justice.
564
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,720
You do justice
565
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,940
when you believe Him.
566
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,660
When you don't believe Him,
567
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,280
then you do injustice.
568
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,260
Is that logical?
569
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,400
If doing justice is
570
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,580
when you believe him,
571
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,920
then not doing justice is
572
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,060
when you don't believe him.
573
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,150
Are you with me?
574
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:35,570
Okay.
575
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,570
And my will is,
576
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,210
if you haven't noticed by now
577
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,170
what His will is,
578
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,930
in Matthew 6:33,
579
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:48,030
and most obviously haven't,
580
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,250
here he is repeating it to us now.
581
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,090
"And my will is
582
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,630
that above all
583
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,090
you think about the needs of the soul."
584
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,070
When he says the needs of the soul,
585
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,010
it is clear to you that he means the needs
586
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,030
of your own soul,
587
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,310
and a man who thinks correctly
588
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,710
about the needs of his soul,
589
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:10,610
immediately understands in his heart
590
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,030
and cannot help but think
591
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,550
about the needs of the souls of others.
592
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:14,610
Logical.
593
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,390
You understand that.
594
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,910
"And my will is
595
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,170
that above all
596
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,410
you think about the needs of the soul.
597
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:27,570
Before you allow
598
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,430
to approach you
599
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,410
earthly worry."
600
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:33,950
So,
601
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,250
you understand,
602
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,330
if we worry,
603
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,930
how will we, what will we do,
604
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,630
if we do his word,
605
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,730
we have already fallen
606
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,330
under the captivity
607
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,170
of the adversary
608
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,330
and fear follows
609
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:55,610
and disbelief,
610
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:58,870
and that keeps us separated from the Father
611
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,690
and prevents Him
612
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,290
from taking care of us
613
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,710
even though he wants to
614
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,250
and he promised us that.
615
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,510
In that state
616
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,230
we are in disbelief.
617
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,330
Whoever worries,
618
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,110
whoever is afraid,
619
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,410
he is in disbelief.
620
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,530
You know when Jesus says in Mark 5:36
621
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:19,910
when he goes to Jairus,
622
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,090
and his daughter died,
623
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,450
don't bother the teacher,
624
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,970
immediately after he said to the woman,
625
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,170
Mark, Mark 5:34,
626
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,490
"Go, your faith has healed you,
627
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:33,030
you are free from your suffering,
628
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,810
in that came from Jairus' house,
629
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,090
they say don't bother the teacher,
630
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,340
Mark 5:34,
631
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:39,570
your daughter is dead,
632
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,410
and Jesus immediately says to him:
633
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,010
"Do not be afraid", one side,
634
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,410
"just believe."
635
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,230
Whoever is afraid,
636
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,210
he does not believe.
637
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,630
Whoever worries,
638
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,870
he doesn't believe.
639
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,430
Do you understand that part?
640
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,220
While you worry
641
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,420
and while you fear
642
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,260
for tomorrow,
643
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,440
you cannot believe.
644
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,420
That is not the walk of the righteous.
645
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:14,470
Because the righteous walk by faith,
646
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,390
and whoever walks by faith,
647
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,290
neither worries nor fears.
648
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:20,730
Isn't that so?
649
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,850
We love You, Jesus.
650
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,750
I would say that this is the first thought completed
651
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,650
in three sentences.
652
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:36,950
We love You, Jesus.
653
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,580
Let's start from the beginning.
654
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,560
Parts of the scripture
655
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,660
that I,
656
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,180
if you are willing,
657
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:56,980
give
658
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,540
for homework
659
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,800
with a view
660
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,080
to everything said
661
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,160
are
662
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,300
1 Corinthians
663
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,720
10:1 to 13.
664
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,960
10:1 to 13.
665
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,340
Psalm 78
666
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,100
and Hebrews chapter 11
667
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,220
with a run-up
668
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,040
through chapter 10.
669
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,090
With a culmination
670
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,030
before entering 11,
671
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,290
with Hebrews 10:38.
672
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:36,230
And all this with the honorable intention
673
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,250
to take seriously
674
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,050
your earthly life.
675
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,930
Because if you fall away from faith,
676
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,470
you will perish,
677
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,110
thereby you will not achieve the goal
678
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:52,430
for which you live on earth.
679
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,290
Unbelief is a sin.
680
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,680
Unbelief is not knowing the Father
681
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,000
and in fact telling Him that He is lying.
682
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,060
It is clear to you that this is much more serious
683
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,800
than, well, I'm a little insecure,
684
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,480
so I don't believe.
685
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,380
That is a much deeper problem.
686
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,400
He gave us
687
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,220
Matthew 6:33
688
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:19,700
and further explained it
689
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,600
in Matthew 6:24-34
690
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,240
and you have booklet 68
691
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,800
that no church has
692
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,740
and you have all my lectures on the topic
693
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,480
that no church has
694
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,500
in the whole world.
695
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,060
And yet
696
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,620
I see
697
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,740
that a good number of people
698
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,880
do not take it seriously.
699
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,720
Therefore
700
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,060
the Father speaks
701
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,280
because He loves us,
702
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:56,920
hear,
703
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,980
hear me,
704
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,680
how I want,
705
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,540
how you should
706
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,900
understand that word.
707
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,240
Which one? Matthew 6:33.
708
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,040
How?
709
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,760
So that always,
710
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,440
not sometimes,
711
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,860
no matter what the circumstances,
712
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,260
always
713
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:26,420
you can
714
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,500
rely on My Fatherly care.
715
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,400
When?
716
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,780
When you do My will.
717
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,680
When you trust in Me.
718
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,000
When you keep My commandments.
719
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,400
Or
720
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,920
you will keep My commandments
721
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,800
when you trust in Me.
722
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,800
That is Psalm 78
723
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,780
and that is the seventh verse.
724
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,100
And in order to be able to,
725
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,260
history,
726
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,180
that's why you have
727
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,380
the Old Testament,
728
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,040
to see My deeds.
729
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,800
How I
730
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,300
stand behind my word
731
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,660
and how I manifest
732
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,320
to those who believe.
733
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,240
And then we have
734
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,440
the history of Israel.
735
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,320
Miraculous deliverance from Egypt.
736
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,900
A miraculous passage
737
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:25,900
through the Red Sea.
738
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:28,840
Miraculous,
739
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,860
miraculous healing
740
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,660
because He is their doctor.
741
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,540
Promised.
742
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,600
Miraculous provision of food
743
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,220
which is manna.
744
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,580
Miraculous provision of drink
745
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,700
which is water from the rock.
746
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,940
Shoes and clothing
747
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,320
did not tear
748
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,620
for 40 years.
749
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,790
Pillar of cloud by day
750
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:55,650
and pillar of fire by night.
751
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,070
Guidance.
752
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,960
Miraculous victory
753
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,160
over the Amalekites.
754
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,360
Moses raises his hands,
755
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,460
when he raises them, they win,
756
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,540
when he lowers them.
757
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,780
We love You, Jesus.
758
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,380
They lose.
759
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,360
Because here someone can understand what it means for Moses to raise his hands
760
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,720
and Moses to lower his hands.
761
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,860
What are hands?
762
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,180
What are your hands for?
763
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,960
Well, for work.
764
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,500
Action.
765
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:23,800
What is Moses?
766
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,580
Moses is divine truth.
767
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,380
When he raises his hands, the application of truth.
768
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:31,700
When he lowers his hands,
769
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,680
no application of truth.
770
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,030
While we practice the truth, we win,
771
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,970
while we don't, we lose.
772
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,110
Does anyone have picture and sound?
773
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,430
But that is not our interest.
774
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,190
Our interest is not the spiritual meaning.
775
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:46,490
And then the miraculous revelation from Sinai.
776
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,650
Thunder, lightning,
777
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:49,750
the mountain shakes,
778
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:50,770
clouds.
779
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,090
And He wants to say,
780
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,390
you must look at My miracles,
781
00:52:57,510 --> 00:52:59,190
keep them in mind, that's Me.
782
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,110
Malachi 3:6.
783
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,790
I do not change,
784
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,050
sons of men.
785
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,840
My Simon,
786
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,540
I'm not sure if it's okay,
787
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,680
I started, I see the eighth seminar.
788
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,620
Will the Mission endure that?
789
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,260
I always refer somehow
790
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,660
to the school system.
791
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,300
You know, like
792
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,960
mathematics, chemistry, biology,
793
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,440
then you have music, technical,
794
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,600
and then the first day is over.
795
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,980
Then you have chemistry, history, literature,
796
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,240
music,
797
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,040
and again physical education, you know.
798
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,280
And then somehow the children can endure it,
799
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,540
many subjects.
800
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,780
Is that a good plan?
801
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,320
I can't wait until I finish
802
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,900
all these seminars to tell you
803
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,900
this message because some will perish in the desert
804
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,200
before it's their turn
805
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:01,400
for these important truths.
806
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,650
He wants us to know
807
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,620
so that we understand
808
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,320
I will take care of you.
809
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:09,900
How?
810
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,120
Hebrews 11:8.
811
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,160
Don't ask, go.
812
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,740
That's how the righteous live,
813
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,720
by faith Abraham,
814
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,560
went,
815
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,980
when he received the call,
816
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,840
not knowing where he was going.
817
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,320
Are you with me?
818
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,020
If you want to know
819
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,770
how it will happen,
820
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,820
how will you be satisfied,
821
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,060
before you fulfill
822
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,860
the first part of Matthew 6:33,
823
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,550
that is the path of the unrighteous,
824
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,880
you are not pleasing to Him,
825
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,860
you are in apostasy.
826
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,100
We love You, Jesus.
827
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,320
And your life is in danger.
828
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,860
We love You, Jesus.
829
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,780
He wants,
830
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,500
we are far from it,
831
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,060
I entered into this revelation,
832
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,960
then I saw that we already had
833
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,400
a mini-seminar, but that doesn't matter at all
834
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,200
because it will be in a new
835
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,920
surge, freshness, and so on.
836
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,840
And He says:
837
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,520
"For to them often
838
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,400
in a miraculous way
839
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,560
My gifts of grace flow."
840
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,720
For He says: "I allow them
841
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,640
to get everything they need
842
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,440
and to them often in a miraculous way
843
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,140
My gifts of grace flow."
844
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,260
"For I do not leave in earthly trouble
845
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,500
anyone who unconditionally
846
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,120
trusts in Me
847
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,520
and who strives to conquer My Kingdom."
848
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,580
That is in the first place.
849
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,600
Because the world won't give you that.
850
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,780
The world won't give you that.
851
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,560
What the world wants,
852
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,960
just the other day while I was reading the Bible
853
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,260
for brave little girls,
854
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,840
Israel in Egypt, it briefly writes like this,
855
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,600
Pharaoh ordered,
856
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,020
that is the Egyptian king,
857
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,800
Satan, the spirit of the Antichrist,
858
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,220
natural thinking,
859
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,360
to kill every male child,
860
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:06,860
of the Hebrews,
861
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,900
that is every spiritual truth.
862
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,200
So that the Hebrews would not multiply
863
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,580
and then rule
864
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,080
or separate from their rule
865
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,800
and no longer be slaves to the natural.
866
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,720
Pharaoh, Satan, the spirit of the Antichrist
867
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,360
wants you not to think first
868
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,240
any spiritual thought,
869
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,400
but to be his slave.
870
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:39,350
I will repeat the main idea to you,
871
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,410
and then we will finish this first part,
872
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,450
it will still be a seminar.
873
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,970
There is no other
874
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,490
foreseen path
875
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,950
for a man
876
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,380
who comes out of Egypt
877
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,320
to enter the promised land,
878
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,220
into blessings,
879
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,700
into heaven,
880
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,700
into union with Christ,
881
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,760
into bliss,
882
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,140
except the path of believing
883
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,440
in His word
884
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,480
or promises.
885
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,020
That is the path of righteousness.
886
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,360
Therefore,
887
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,740
when you seek the Kingdom
888
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:17,860
in the first place,
889
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,000
that is how righteousness is lived
890
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,480
and His righteousness,
891
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,760
by faith,
892
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,580
in His word.
893
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,900
And that means
894
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,500
that He takes care,
895
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,740
He is your shepherd,
896
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,280
because you have given Him to be your Lord.
897
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,940
And He is your Lord
898
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,520
when you do His word.
899
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,040
If you don't live like that,
900
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,480
that is the life of the unrighteous
901
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,660
and the path to destruction.
902
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,060
"My soul will not be pleased with him,
903
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,800
who turns away from that faith
904
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,280
and cannot please Me."
905
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,060
Hebrews 10:38
906
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,780
and Hebrews 11:6
907
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,480
In Jesus' name, I bless you.
908
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:01,970
And you would do well
909
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:02,530
if you
910
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:06,090
would make an effort,
911
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,430
left time
912
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,750
and with repeated listening
913
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,930
of this sermon
914
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,790
did their homework.
915
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:16,870
Amen.
916
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,770
